# Ripe Potatoes
Culturally relevant, critically irrelevant.

Welcome to "Ripe Potatoes," the ultimate destination for movie enthusiasts seeking honest and insightful reviews of films that may have received a Rotten Tomato score of less than 60. Here at Ripe Potatoes, we understand that critical acclaim doesn't always align with personal taste, and we aim to provide a platform where movies with lower scores can still find their audience.
